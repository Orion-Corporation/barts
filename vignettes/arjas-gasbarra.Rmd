## Simulating a 2-arm trial: Experiment 1

Section 3.1.1 investigates the effect of different parameter combinations in Rule 1.
With bat, we can easily define the parameter combinations under investigation:

```{r rule-1-setup}
rules <- list(
  a = rule_1(delta = 0.10, epsilon = 0.10),
  b = rule_1(delta = 0.10, epsilon = 0.05),
  c = rule_1(delta = 0.05, epsilon = 0.20)
)

# Investigated hypotheses
theta_null <- c(0.3, 0.3)
theta_alt <- c(0.3, 0.5)
```

To create a single realization of a study, we can use `simulate_phase()`:

```{r rule-1-single}
main_phase <- phase(n = 500, rule = rules[["a"]])
results <- simulate_phase(main_phase, a = 1, b = 1, theta = theta_alt)
```

The results track for each arm the prior parameters over time (`a` and `b`),
the probability of being the best (`p`), and the activity state (`I`).
Included is also the rule's next suggested allocation (`A`) , as well as the
simulated `data`. The used allocation rule is stored in the `"rule"` attribute.

```{r rule-1-single-str}
str(results)
```

The `plot()` method gives us a simple summary of a single phase's results:

```{r rule-1-single-plot}
plot(results)
```

## Simulating a 4-arm trial: Experiment 2
